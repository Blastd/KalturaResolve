# UnimibKalturaResolver
This firefox extension is meant to replace Kaltura video player with the direct video file to the lesson

 [!] Warning
 I do not study at Unimib, anymore. In the near future I might lose access to the University's moodle page.
 I'm open to help others contribute and push an update to Mozilla's store.
